Previous to this incident, Shannon had spent most of the year prior committing a series of arsons and acid attacks against abortion clinics in Oregon, California, Nevada, and Idaho. Over this same period she had written 25 letters to Michael Griffin, who in 1993 murdered an abortion provider, and had visited John Brockhoeft, who was convicted for firebombing an abortion clinic. On the day of the attempted murder Shannon has been attending a small demonstration outside of Dr. George Tiller's clinic. When Dr. Tiller emerged from the building a small fracas ensued, which Shannon utilized to shoot Dr. Tiller. He was hit in the arm and was injured.
